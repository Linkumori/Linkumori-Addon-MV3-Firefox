# ClearURLs Custom Rules Builder - NOTICE

## About This Build

This directory contains files generated by the ClearURLs Custom Rules Builder script with Linkumori enhancements.

### What This Script Does

The ClearURLs Custom Rules Builder performs the following operations:

1. **Fetches Official Rules**: Downloads the latest official ClearURLs rules from the GitHub repository
2. **Loads Custom Rules**: Reads your custom URL cleaning rules from a local JSON file
3. **Merges Providers**: Intelligently combines providers that share the same URL pattern to optimize performance
   - **Official Name Priority**: When merging, official provider names are preserved over custom ones
4. **Adds Linkumori Metadata**: Includes project metadata, automatic versioning (27.02.2026.0001), and repository information
5. **Generates Output**: Creates both regular and minified versions of the merged ruleset
6. **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate rules within merged providers
7. **Validation**: Ensures all custom rules have proper structure and required fields

### Versioning System

This build uses automatic date-time based versioning:
- **Format**: dd.mm.yyyy.HHMM
- **Current Version**: 27.02.2026.0001
- **Example**: 31.07.2025.1430 (July 31, 2025 at 14:30)

This ensures each build has a unique version identifier based on when it was created.
