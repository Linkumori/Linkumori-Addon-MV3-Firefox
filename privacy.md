# Linkumori Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 27, 2026 

## Information We Collect

Nothing.

Linkumori does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data.

All extension data is stored locally on your device. No information is sent to any external servers. When you uninstall the extension, all locally stored data is permanently deleted.

## Remote Rules (Optional Feature)

The Remote Rules feature is disabled by default.

When enabled, you may choose to provide custom URLs from which the extension can download additional URL-cleaning rules.

### When Remote Rules Is Enabled

- The extension downloads rule files from the URLs you specify.
- Your browser connects directly to those third-party servers.
- Those servers may collect standard web server information (such as IP address, browser type, request logs, etc.).
- Linkumori does not control, monitor, or store any data from these connections.
- We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party servers. Please review their privacy policies before enabling this feature.
- This feature is intended exclusively for advanced users who have full control over both their physical and virtual infrastructure (for example, servers hosting rules or software managing server operations).

### When Remote Rules Is Disabled

Linkumori operates entirely offline using only its built-in rules. No external network requests are made.

## Age and Legal Consent

If you are unable to provide legal consent under the laws of your jurisdiction (for example, if you are a minor or require guardian permission), you are advised not to use this extension.

Regardless of age or consent status, Linkumori does not collect or process any personal data.

For clarification, in the event of any conflict between this privacy policy and either local law or the software license, the software license and applicable local law shall prevail in the context of data collection and privacy.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected by revising the "Last Updated" date above.

Each version of the extension includes an accompanying privacy policy. You can access the privacy policy for your specific version by clicking the extension icon to open the popup, then navigating to "License" and clicking "Legal" to view the applicable license and privacy policy.

If you upgrade from one version to another (for example, from version 21 to version 22), the privacy policy bundled with the newer version will apply. It is important to note that the accompanying privacy policy is distinguished not by version number but by its "Last Updated" date.


We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
