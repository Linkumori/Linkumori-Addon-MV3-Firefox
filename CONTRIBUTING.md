## 1. Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

- Read this document in full
- Review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) — security vulnerabilities must **not** be reported as regular issues
- Familiarise yourself with the [project repository](https://github.com/Linkumori/Linkumori-Addon-MV3-Firefox)

---

## 2. Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute beyond writing code:

- **Bug reports** — found something broken? Open an issue
- **Feature suggestions** — have an idea? Open a discussion or issue
- **URL cleaning rules** — suggest new tracking parameters or providers to add to the ruleset
- **Translations** — help localise the extension for other languages via `_locales/`
- **Documentation** — improve README, wiki, or inline code comments
- **Code** — fix bugs, implement features, or improve performance

---

## 3. Development Setup

### Requirements

Install one of the following runtimes before building:

- [Node.js (current version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
- [Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation)

A Unix-based system (macOS or Linux) is recommended. Windows is supported but the build scripts are primarily tested on Unix-like environments.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linkumori/Linkumori-Addon-MV3-Firefox.git
cd Linkumori-Addon-MV3-Firefox
```

### Build the Extension (Unsigned)

If Node.js is installed:
```bash
node linkumori-cli-tool.js
```

If Bun is installed:
```bash
bun start
```

Then select: **Build Extension (Full Build)**

Output will be in `web-ext-artifacts/`.

### Load the Extension in Firefox (Temporary)

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**
3. Select `web-ext-artifacts/output.zip` or `output.xpi`

### Build a Signed Version

1. Log in to [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org) and go to **Tools → Manage API Keys** to generate credentials
2. Run the CLI tool and select **Setup Project** — this creates `.env.template`
3. Paste your API keys into `.env.template` and convert it to `.env` when prompted
4. Run the CLI tool again and select **Build & Sign Extension**

---

## 5. Making Changes

### Branching

- Always branch off from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `fix/issue-description` for bug fixes
  - `feat/feature-description` for new features
  - `docs/what-you-changed` for documentation
  - `rules/provider-name` for new URL cleaning rules

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
fix: correct etag filter false positive on redirect
feat: add support for Yandex tracking parameters
docs: update contributing guidelines
rules: add Amazon affiliate parameter stripping
```

### Generating Commit History

To view full modification history for third-party files, run the CLI tool and select **Generate Commit History**. This produces a `COMMIT_HISTORY.md` with a per-file log of changes.

---

## 6. Code Standards

### General

- Write clean, readable JavaScript — prioritise clarity over cleverness
- Avoid introducing new external dependencies unless absolutely necessary; all third-party code must be reviewed and attributed in `LICENSE.md`
- Do not use inline scripts — the extension enforces `script-src 'self'` via CSP
- Do not make network requests from extension code unless strictly required and clearly documented

### Security & Privacy

- All URL processing must happen **locally** — no data should leave the browser
- Do not add permissions to `manifest.json` without discussion and clear justification
- Be mindful of `host_permissions` scope — the extension already requests broad access and any changes must be carefully considered
- Content scripts should be scoped as narrowly as possible

### Internationalisation (i18n)

- All user-facing strings must use the `linkumori-i18n.js` system and be defined in `_locales/en/messages.json`
- Do not hardcode English strings directly in HTML or JS files

### Third-Party Code

- Any new third-party code must be documented in `LICENSE.md` with copyright holder, license, and any modifications made
- Modified third-party code must include an inline notice referencing the original source
- Licenses must be compatible with LGPL v3.0

---

## 7. Adding or Updating URL Rules

URL cleaning rules tell Linkumori which tracking parameters to strip, which domains to apply them to, and how to handle redirects. User-defined rules live in `data/custom-rules.json`.

> **Do not edit `data/downloaded-official-rules.json`** — this file is maintained upstream by the ClearURLs project and is overwritten on updates.

---

### Rule File Structure

`data/custom-rules.json` follows this top-level structure:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "providerName": {
      ...provider fields...
    },
    "anotherProvider": {
      ...provider fields...
    }
  }
}
```

Each key inside `providers` is a unique name for that provider (website or service). Provider names are arbitrary but should be lowercase and descriptive.

---

### All Provider Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `urlPattern` | string (regex) | One of `urlPattern` or `domainPatterns` required | Regex matched against the full URL to identify this provider |
| `domainPatterns` | array of strings | One of `urlPattern` or `domainPatterns` required | AdBlock-style domain patterns (see Domain Patterns below) |
| `completeProvider` | boolean | Yes | If `true`, blocks all requests to this provider entirely (domain blocking) |
| `forceRedirection` | boolean | No | If `true`, forces following redirects even without a matching redirection rule |
| `rules` | array of strings (regex) | No | Query parameter names to strip from the URL |
| `rawRules` | array of strings (regex) | No | Regex patterns applied directly to the raw URL string before parameter parsing |
| `referralMarketing` | array of strings (regex) | No | Affiliate/referral parameters — stripped separately and can be toggled by the user |
| `exceptions` | array of strings (regex) | No | Full URL regex patterns — matching URLs are skipped even if they match `urlPattern` |
| `domainExceptions` | array of strings | No | AdBlock-style domain patterns — matching domains are skipped |
| `redirections` | array of strings (regex) | No | Regex patterns to unwrap redirect URLs; must capture the real destination URL |
| `domainRedirections` | array of strings | No | AdBlock-style domain patterns that trigger redirect unwrapping |
| `methods` | array of strings | No | HTTP methods to apply rules to (e.g. `"GET"`, `"POST"`). If omitted, applies to all |
| `resourceTypes` | array of strings | No | Browser resource types to apply rules to (e.g. `"main_frame"`, `"sub_frame"`, `"xmlhttprequest"`) |

---

### Choosing: `urlPattern` vs `domainPatterns`

The provider requires **one** of these two fields to identify which URLs it applies to:

**`urlPattern`** — a standard JavaScript regex matched against the full URL string:
```json
"urlPattern": "^https?://([a-z0-9-]+\\.)?example\\.com/"
```

**`domainPatterns`** — an array of AdBlock-style domain patterns (simpler and preferred for most cases):
```json
"domainPatterns": ["||example.com^", "||example.co.uk^"]
```

---

### Domain Patterns Syntax

Domain patterns use AdBlock-style notation. The following formats are supported:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `\|\|example.com^` | `example.com` and all subdomains (e.g. `www.example.com`, `sub.example.com`) |
| `\|\|example.*^` | `example.com`, `example.co.uk`, `example.de`, etc. — any TLD. Only matches root domain and `www.` prefix |
| `\|\|*.example.com^` | All subdomains of `example.com` but not `example.com` itself |
| `\|\|*.example.*^` | All subdomains of `example` across any TLD |
| `\|\|example.com/path` | `example.com` and subdomains, but only on URLs starting with `/path` |

Examples:

```json
"domainPatterns": [
  "||example.com^",
  "||example.*^",
  "||cdn.example.com^",
  "||example.com/redirect"
]
```

---

### `rules` — Stripping Query Parameters

Each rule is a regex pattern matched against **query parameter keys** (not values). Parameters whose keys match are removed from the URL.

```json
"rules": [
  "utm_source",
  "utm_medium",
  "utm_campaign",
  "utm_term",
  "utm_content",
  "utm_[a-z]+",
  "fbclid",
  "gclid",
  "mc_eid",
  "tracking_id"
]
```

Rules use anchored matching (`^rule$`), so `"ref"` will only match a parameter named exactly `ref`, not `referral`. To match both, use `"ref(erral)?"`.

---

### `rawRules` — Raw URL String Replacement

Raw rules are regex patterns applied directly to the entire URL string via `String.replace()` **before** query parameters are parsed. Use these for tracking tokens embedded in the URL path rather than as query parameters.

```json
"rawRules": [
  "/ref=[^&]*",
  ";jsessionid=[^?]*"
]
```

> Use `rawRules` sparingly — incorrect patterns can corrupt the URL.

---

### `referralMarketing` — Affiliate Parameters

Same syntax as `rules`, but these are treated as a separate category. Users can choose to keep or strip affiliate/referral parameters independently of standard tracking parameters.

```json
"referralMarketing": [
  "ref",
  "tag",
  "affiliate_id",
  "partner"
]
```

---

### `exceptions` — Skip Specific URLs

Regex patterns matched against the full URL. If a URL matches an exception, the provider's rules are not applied to it even if the URL matches `urlPattern` or `domainPatterns`.

```json
"exceptions": [
  "^https?://example\\.com/checkout",
  "^https?://api\\.example\\.com/"
]
```

---

### `domainExceptions` — Skip Specific Domains

AdBlock-style domain patterns (same syntax as `domainPatterns`) for domains that should be excluded from this provider's rules.

```json
"domainExceptions": [
  "||safe.example.com^"
]
```

---

### `redirections` — Unwrap Redirect URLs

Regex patterns matched against the full URL. The **first capture group** must capture the real destination URL. Linkumori will navigate to the captured URL instead.

```json
"redirections": [
  "^https?://example\\.com/redirect\\?url=([^&]*)",
  "^https?://out\\.example\\.com/\\?link=(.*)"
]
```

The captured value is automatically decoded before navigation.

---

### `domainRedirections`

AdBlock-style domain patterns that flag a domain as a redirect wrapper, triggering redirect unwrapping logic.

```json
"domainRedirections": [
  "||out.example.com^"
]
```

---

### `methods` — Limit by HTTP Method

By default rules apply to all HTTP methods. Use `methods` to restrict to specific ones:

```json
"methods": ["GET"]
```

---

### `resourceTypes` — Limit by Resource Type

By default rules apply to all resource types. Use `resourceTypes` to restrict to specific browser resource types:

```json
"resourceTypes": ["main_frame", "sub_frame"]
```

Common values: `main_frame`, `sub_frame`, `stylesheet`, `script`, `image`, `font`, `object`, `xmlhttprequest`, `ping`, `media`, `websocket`, `other`.

---

### Complete Example

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "example-shop": {
      "domainPatterns": ["||example.com^", "||example.*^"],
      "completeProvider": false,
      "forceRedirection": false,
      "rules": [
        "utm_[a-z]+",
        "fbclid",
        "gclid",
        "tracking_id",
        "session_id"
      ],
      "rawRules": [
        ";jsessionid=[^?#]*"
      ],
      "referralMarketing": [
        "ref",
        "tag",
        "affiliate"
      ],
      "exceptions": [
        "^https?://api\\.example\\.com/"
      ],
      "domainExceptions": [
        "||payments.example.com^"
      ],
      "redirections": [
        "^https?://([a-z0-9-]+\\.)?example\\.com/out\\?url=([^&]*)"
      ],
      "methods": ["GET"],
      "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Branch Naming for Rule Changes

Use the `rules/` prefix when branching for rule-only contributions:

```bash
git checkout -b rules/amazon-affiliate-params
git checkout -b rules/new-provider-example-com
```

---

### What Not to Add

- Do not add rules that would break legitimate website functionality
- Do not set `completeProvider: true` without strong justification and discussion
- Do not use overly broad `urlPattern` or `domainPatterns` that could match unintended sites
- Do not modify `data/downloaded-official-rules.json` — it is maintained upstream and overwritten on updates

---

## 8. Submitting a Pull Request
