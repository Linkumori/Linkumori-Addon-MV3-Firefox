Linkumori Modification Notice on 25 febuary 2026 (25/02/2026)

=============================

Copyright (c) 2026 Subham Mahesh

The Linkumori-modified portions of this file are licensed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later (LGPL-3.0-or-later).

Summary of Linkumori changes:
1. Removed optional WebAssembly acceleration code and related state/methods
   (`enableWASM`, `disableWASM`, `_wasmMemory`, `_wasmPromise`,
   `_getPublicSuffixPosWASM`), keeping a JS-only implementation.
2. Simplified buffer allocation to use standard JavaScript typed arrays only,
   with no WASM memory growth path.
3. Retained the core PSL parsing/matching behavior while adapting this file for
   Linkumori runtime integration and maintenance.

For Linkumori distribution and compliance tracking, Linkumori chooses to comply
with the **Apache License 2.0** option offered by the upstream dual license for
`external_js/publicsuffixlist.js`.

Original upstream notices and licensing statements for non-modified portions
remain above and continue to apply to their respective code sections.
